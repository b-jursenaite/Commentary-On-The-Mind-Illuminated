### First Interlude - Conscious Experience and the Objectives of Meditation:

* The two forms of consciousness are **attention** and **peripheral**
awareness.

* The two objectives of meditation practice are **stable attention**
  and **mindfulness** (i.e. an appropriate balance of attention and
  peripheral awareness).

*  There are three forms of spontaneous attention movement: scanning,
   captured, and alternating.  Alternating attention permits the
   illusion of simultaneous attention to multiple objects.

*  Attention to attention is impossible but awareness of attention is
possible (and desireable).

*  When directed introspectively, attention takes a snapshot from
   awareness from the previous moment.  However introspective
   awareness apprehends the state of mind in the present.

### Stage One - Establishing a Practice:

Six Point Preparation

1.  Fire up motivation
2.  Set reasonable goals
3.  Beware of expectations
4.  Commit to diligence
5.  Review potential distractions
6.  Adjust posture

Four Step Transition:

1.  Establish open attention and awareness grounded in present
sensations.
2.  Focus on body sensations.
3.  Focus on breath sensations.
4.  Focus on breath sensations at the nose.

Initially, count breaths.  Count at the end of the in-breath.

Commentary and Questions:

1.  What would be a good transition for fire kasina?
2.  Count up to 8 then back down. (Because 8, as a power of 2, is
    holy! ;))

### Second Interlude - The Hindrances and Problems:

### Stage Two - Interrupted Attention and Overcoming Mind-Wandering:

### Stage Three - Extended Continuity of Attention and Overcoming Forgetting:

### Third Interlude - How Mindfulness Works:


### Stage Four - Continuous Attention and Overcoming Gross Distraction and Strong Dullness:

Goal: Overcome gross distraction and strong dullness.

Obstacles: Physical discomfort, emotional discomfort, intellectual insight.

Skills: Developing continuous
introspective awareness which acts as an early warning detector for subtle
distraction becoming gross distraction and subtle dullness becoming
strong dullness.

Mastery: Object remains in foreground.  Object not subject to
hypnogotic distortion.

### Fourth Interlude - The Moments of Consciousness Model:

*  In the "moments of consciousnes model", experience is composed of a
discrete sequence of moments.

* Each moment is either perceiving or non-perceiving.  Non-perceiving
  moments have no further structure.  Perceiving moments have detailed
  internal structure described in the following bullet points.

*  Each perceiving moment is one of seven types: sight, sound, smell, taste,
touch, mind, or binding.

*  Each perceiving moment is either a moment of attention or a moment of
peripheral awareness.

* Each perceiving moment has an active component of **conscious
intention**.

* Each moment  contains **vital energy**, perceiving moments more so
than non-perceiving moments.

* The greater density of non-perceiving moments, the greater the
  subjective experience of dullness.

* **Subtle distractions** correspond to a local section of the mind
  moment sequence
  where there is a significant-yet-minority density of moments of attention devoted
  to objects other than the meditation object.

*  **Gross distractions** correspond to a local section of the mind
  moment sequence
  where there is a majority density of moments of attention devoted
  to objects other than the meditation object.

*  **Forgetting** corresponds to all or nearly all attention mind
moments being devoted to objects other than the meditation object.

*  It is important to mention that the level of distraction is
independent of the density of moments of **awareness**.

* The following image from the text illustrates the properties of mind
moments.  Notice each of the moments in the illustration is a
perceiving moment.

*  Increasing mindfulness corresponds to increasing the density of
   perceiving mind moments..
