### First Interlude - Conscious Experience and the Objectives of Meditation:

* The two forms of consciousness are **attention** and **peripheral**
awareness.

* The two objectives of meditation practice are **stable attention**
  and **mindfulness** (i.e. an appropriate balance of attention and
  peripheral awareness).

*  There are three forms of spontaneous attention movement: scanning,
   captured, and alternating.  Alternating attention permits the
   illusion of simultaneous attention to multiple objects.

*  Attention to attention is impossible but awareness of attention is
possible (and desirable).

*  When directed introspectively, attention takes a snapshot from
   awareness from the previous moment.  However introspective
   awareness apprehends the state of mind in the present.

Commentary:

1.  In TMI, attention and peripheral awareness are presented as a fundamental
dichotomy.  Is experience really structured this discretely?  Can
attention and awareness be seen as inhabiting points on a continuum?

### Stage One - Establishing a Practice:

Six Point Preparation

1.  Fire up motivation
2.  Set reasonable goals
3.  Beware of expectations
4.  Commit to diligence
5.  Review potential distractions
6.  Adjust posture

Four Step Transition:

1.  Establish open attention and awareness grounded in present
sensations.
2.  Focus on body sensations.
3.  Focus on breath sensations.
4.  Focus on breath sensations at the nose.

Initially, count breaths.  Count at the end of the in-breath.

Commentary and Questions:

1.  What would be a good transition for fire kasina?
2.  Count up to 8 then back down. (Because 8, as a power of 2, is
    holy! ;))

### Second Interlude - The Hindrances and Problems:

*  The Five Hinderances:

1.  Desire
2.  Aversion
3.  Laziness/Lethargy
4.  Remorse/Worry
5.  Doubt

*  The Seven Problems (and Antidotes):

1.  Procrastination (recall benefits)
2.  Distractions (Stages 2 - 6)
3.  Impatience (observe dispassionately)
4.  Monkey Mind (ground in the body)
5.  Self-doubt (keep motivation strong and drop comparison)
6.  Dullness (Stages 3 - 5)
7.  Physical Discomfort (assume most comfortable position then observe dispassionately.  repeat as necessary)


### Stage Two - Interrupted Attention and Overcoming Mind-Wandering:

### Stage Three - Extended Continuity of Attention and Overcoming Forgetting:

### Third Interlude - How Mindfulness Works:


### Stage Four - Continuous Attention and Overcoming Gross Distraction and Strong Dullness:

Goal: Overcome gross distraction and strong dullness.

Obstacles: Physical discomfort, emotional discomfort, intellectual insight.

Skills: Developing continuous
introspective awareness which acts as an early warning detector for subtle
distraction becoming gross distraction and subtle dullness becoming
strong dullness.

Mastery: Object remains in foreground.  Object not subject to
hypnogogic distortion.

*  Overcome *present* gross distraction by letting go of the
distraction without negative judgement and re-engaging with the object.

*  Overcome *potential* gross distraction, i.e. present subtle
   distraction, by first detecting it using introspective awareness
   and then tightening up focus on the object.

*  Overcome strong dullness by applying whatever antidote is effective
   for waking up the mind, e.g. standing meditation, a deep breath,
   systemic muscle contractions, or a splash of cold water.

Commentary:

1.  When using fire kasina, one technique to help overcome gross
    distraction is "rating" the quality of the afterimage (I use a
    scale of 0 - 3) as it fades, one rating at the end of each breath.

### Fourth Interlude - The Moments of Consciousness Model:

*  In the "moments of consciousness model", experience is composed of a
discrete sequence of moments.

* Each moment is either perceiving or non-perceiving.  Non-perceiving
  moments have no further structure.  Perceiving moments have detailed
  internal structure described in the following bullet points.

*  Each perceiving moment is one of seven types: sight, sound, smell, taste,
touch, mind, or binding.

*  Each perceiving moment is either a moment of attention or a moment of
peripheral awareness.

* Each perceiving moment has an active component of **conscious
intention**.

* Each moment  contains **vital energy**, perceiving moments more so
than non-perceiving moments.

* The greater density of non-perceiving moments, the greater the
subjective experience of dullness.

* **Subtle distractions** correspond to a local section of the mind
  moment sequence
  where there is a significant-yet-minority density of moments of attention devoted
  to objects other than the meditation object.

*  **Gross distractions** correspond to a local section of the mind
  moment sequence
  where there is a majority density of moments of attention devoted
  to objects other than the meditation object.

*  **Forgetting** corresponds to all or nearly all attention mind
moments being devoted to objects other than the meditation object.

*  It is important to mention that the level of distraction is
independent of the density of moments of **awareness**.

INSERT IMAGE HERE.

* The following image from the text illustrates the various attributes of mind
moments.  Notice each of the moments in the illustration is a
perceiving moment.

*  In this model, increasing mindfulness corresponds to increasing the density of
perceiving mind moments.

Commentary:

1.  Mind moments can be mathematically formalized as an appropriate n-tuple.

2.  The dichotomy of stable and progressive subtle dullness can be
    mathematically refined and expanded.  Recall that dullness is measured by the
    density of non-perceiving moments.  The time derivative of this
    density measures the *velocity* of dullness (subtle or
    otherwise).  Stable dullness corresponds to a derivative of zero
    and progressive dullness corresponds to a positive derivative.

### Stage Five - Overcoming Subtle Dullness and Increasing Mindfulness:

Goal: Overcome subtle dullness and increase power of mindfulness.

Obstacles: Subtle dullness is difficult to recognize, creates an
illusion of stable attention and is seductively pleasant.

Skills: Increased cultivation of continuous introspective awareness.
Body scanning for increased mindfulness.

Mastery: Ability to sustain or increase the power of mindfulness
during each meditation session.

*  **Intention** to detect subtle dullness increases introspective
awareness.

* Body scanning technique:
