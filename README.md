# Commentary-On-The-Mind-Illuminated
This repository is intended to be a summary of, guide to, and
commentary on the book _The Mind Illuminated_ by Culadasa (John Yates,
Ph.D.), Matthew Immergut, Ph.D. and Jeremy Graves.

We also include commentary regarding integrating the framework
outlined in _The Mind Illuminated_ and the Fire Kasina as the
meditation object rather than the breath.  The breath is the example object
used throughout the book.

The motivation for this
repository is a deep appreciation for the capability of the detailed,
structured path described in _The Mind Illuminated_ to facilitate fundamental
and liberating insights.  The hope is that the reflections contained
herein may provide clarity both to myself and others working within
this framework.

The contents of this repository are in no way to be interpreted as
approved or endorsed by the aforementioned authors.  All errors and
misinterpretations are strictly the fault of the collaborators on this
repository.

Collaboration and pull requests are welcome.

May all beings be happy.  May all beings be free.
